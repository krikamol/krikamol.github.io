abstract: "Counterfactual invariance has proven an essential property for predictors that are fair, robust, and generalizable in the real world. We propose a general definition of counterfactual invariance and provide simple graphical criteria that yield a sufficient condition for a predictor to be counterfactually invariant in terms of (conditional independence in) the observational distribution. Any predictor that satisfies our criterion is provably counterfactually invariant. In order to learn such predictors, we propose a model-agnostic framework, called Counterfactual Invariance Prediction (CIP), based on a kernel-based conditional dependence measure called Hilbert-Schmidt Conditional Independence Criterion (HSCIC). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CIP in enforcing counterfactual invariance across various types of data including tabular, high-dimensional, and real-world dataset."
