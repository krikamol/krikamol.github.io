abstract: "This paper investigates domain generalization: How to take knowledge acquired from
an arbitrary number of related domains and
apply it to previously unseen domains? We
propose Domain-Invariant Component Analysis (DICA), a kernel-based optimization algorithm that learns an invariant transformation by minimizing the dissimilarity across
domains, whilst preserving the functional relationship between input and output variables. A learning-theoretic analysis shows
that reducing dissimilarity improves the expected generalization ability of classifiers on
new domains, motivating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that DICA
successfully learns invariant features and improves classifier performance in practice."
