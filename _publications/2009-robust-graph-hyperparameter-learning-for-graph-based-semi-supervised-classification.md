abstract: "Graph-based semi-supervised learning has attracted much
attention in recent years. Many successful methods rely on graph structure to propagate labels from labeled data to unlabeled data. Although
graph structure affects the performance of the system, only few works
address its construction problem. In this work, the graph structure is
constructed by adjusting the hyperparameter controlling the connection
weights between nodes. The idea is to learn the hyperparameters for
graphs that yields low leave-one-out prediction error on labeled data
while retaining high stability of the prediction on unlabeled data. The
problem is solved efficiently using the gradient-based optimization technique. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique yields
improvement of generalization error as well as stability of the labeling
function."
