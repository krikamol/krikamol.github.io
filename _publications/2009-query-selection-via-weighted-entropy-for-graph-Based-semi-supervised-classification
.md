abstract: "There has recently been a large effort in using unlabeled data
in conjunction with labeled data in machine learning. Semi-supervised
learning and active learning are two well-known techniques that exploit
the unlabeled data in the learning process. In this work, the active learning is used to query a label for an unlabeled data on top of a semisupervised classifier. This work focuses on the query selection criterion.
The proposed criterion selects the example for which the label change
results in the largest pertubation of other examplesâ€™ label. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of the proposed query selection criterion in
comparison to existing techniques."
