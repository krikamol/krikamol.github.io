abstract: "We introduce a conditional density estimation
model termed the conditional density operator. It naturally
captures multivariate, multimodal output densities and is
competitive with recent neural conditional density models
and Gaussian processes. To derive the model, we propose a novel
approach to the reconstruction of probability densities from
their kernel mean embeddings by drawing connections to estimation
of Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). We prove finite sample error bounds which are
independent of problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the resulting
conditional density model is applied to real-world data and we
demonstrate its versatility and competitive performance."
