<strong>Summary:</strong>
<p>I have a broad interest in machine learning, an important subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The emergence of data as a new natural resource for governmental organizations, private sectors, and scientific institutions has increased its value considerably. The goal of my research are to understand-both theoretically and practically-different ingredients of machine learning and how they interact, and then to leverage this knowledge in developing better learning algorithms that will contribute to this movement. I believe it will not only increase the practical merit of machine learning in our society, but also provide insights into the foundation of learning that paves the way for building a truly intelligent machine, which is an ultimate goal of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The current themes of my research are summarized below.</p>
