<p>I have a broad interest in machine learning, an important subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). When machine learning models are trained on observational data, the models reflect society as it exists today as well as our own understanding of the world.</p>

<p>The goal of my research are to understand---both theoretically and practically---different stages of learning from data, ranging from data generating process to deployment of the models, and then to leverage this knowledge in developing better learning algorithms. I believe it will not only increase the practical merit of machine learning in our society, but also provide insights into the foundation of learning that paves the way for building a truly intelligent machine, which is an ultimate goal of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>To answer the aforementioned question, I am pursuing several research directions as stepping stones. The current themes of my research are summarized below.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Decision Making</h3>

<p>
While machines that outperform human at prediction tasks have become inexpensive to build, machines that can mimic human judgement and decision is still out of reach. A rapid deployment of predictive models in important sectors such as online advertising, criminal justice, education, and labor market has raised widespread concerns about the societal impact of algorithmic decisions. Complex decisions based on model predictions alone-even when they are perfect-can lead to unintended consequences such as discrimination and unfairness. Unlike a prediction, making a good decision from past data can be challenging because (i) it involves making counterfactual prediction and reasoning about potential outcomes, (ii) there can be many, interrelated factors or alternatives to consider, e.g., self-driving cars, (iii) the impact of the decision may be significant, e.g., health care and justice system, and (iv) the decisions may be subject to a strategic behavior. My goal is to bridge the gap between machine prediction and human judgement by exploring ideas in economics, mechanism design, game theory, and offline reinforcement learning.
