<p>Hallo! My name is Krikamol Muandet (ไกรกมล หมื่นเดช). I am a research group leader affiliated with the Empirical Inference Department at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany. From January 2016 to December 2017, I was a lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University in Thailand. My research interest lies in the area known as "machine learning". I am particularly interested in, for example, statistical learning theory, kernel methods, Bayesian nonparametric, large-scale learning, and counterfactual prediction (see a full list of my publications for details). When I am not doing research, I enjoy reading books (on topics related to philosophy, psychology, history of science, etc) and watching movies. I also like outdoor sports such as bouldering, climbing, and snowboarding (if the weather permits).</p>

<p>As a PhD student, I have worked primarily with Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf. In December 2015, I was awarded the doctoral degree with summa cum laude, that is, "with greatest honor", from the University of Tübingen. I previously obtained a master's degree with distinction in machine learning from University College London (UCL), United Kingdom. At UCL, I worked primarily with Prof. Yee Whye Teh. (M.Sc. thesis advisor) at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit and	Prof. John Shawe-Taylor (M.Sc. Tutor) at the Center for Computational Statistics and Machine Learning. During my PhD, I was a visiting scholar at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Japan; Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, New York University; Palomar Observatory in San Diego; American Museum of Natural History, and Institut für Stochastik und Anwendungen, University of Stuttgart, among others.</p>

<p>In 2011, it was a great honour for me to co-organize a Festschrift symposium to honor Prof. Vladimir Vapnik, on the occasion of his 75th birthday. I also helped organize the 29th Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016) and Data, Learning, and Inference (DALI 2019) workshop. In December 2016, I was also invited to participate in the Dagstuhl Seminar in New Directions for Learning with Kernels and Gaussian Processes. At the seminar, we discussed various prospects of kernel methods in machine learning.</p>

<p>I always seek new collaboration. If you are interested in working with me, I will be glad to hear from you.</p>
