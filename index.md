<p>My current research aims to develop machine learning techniques that will bridge the gap between randomized experiments and empirical inference.</p>

<br>
<p>Hallo! My name is Krikamol Muandet (ไกรกมล หมื่นเดช). I am a research group leader affiliated with the Empirical Inference Department at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany. From January 2016 to December 2017, I was a lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University in Thailand. My research interest lies in the area known as "machine learning". I am particularly interested in, for example, statistical learning theory, kernel methods, Bayesian nonparametric, large-scale learning, and counterfactual prediction (see a full list of my publications for details). When I am not doing research, I enjoy reading books (on topics related to philosophy, psychology, history of science, etc) and watching movies. I also like outdoor sports such as bouldering, climbing, and snowboarding (if the weather permits).</p>

<p>I always seek new collaboration, I will be glad to hear from you.</p>
